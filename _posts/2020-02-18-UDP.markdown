User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the sibling of TCP in that they are both transport layer protocols. However, UDP differs from TCP in many important ways. These differences result in drastically different use-cases among these two protocols. <!--more-->On one hand, the complex nature of TCP provides a reliable connection between two devices, while on the other hand, the simple nature of UDP provides performant, albeit unreliable transmission of data between two devices. Given this cursory description, UDP shares similar models of responsibility in that they are both connectionless protocols operating on a best-effort delivery model.

Moreover, UDP splits data into packets called datagrams. The datagrams are then sent to the appropriate destination over IP. Unlike TCP, UDP does not require "handshakes" to open a channel of communication between devices. As a result, data can be sent to the receiving device without even an acknowledgement or agreement of communication (Yes, this is indeed perfect for DDOS-ing!). As we see, the reduced responsibility of UDP makes it perfect for situations where transmissions are time-sensitive such as Voice over IP (VoIP), online multiplayer gaming, live video streams. The keen reader may notice that UDP does not provide any datagram ordering, error control, flow control. It is precisely these lower requirements that achieve speedier transmission at the cost of many quality checks.

The UDP header is fixed at 64 bits and is composed of the following.

| Field            |Bits|   | Description		 |
|:---------------- |:--:|---|:-------------------|
| Source Port      | 16 |   | the sending port	 |
| Destination Port | 16 |   | the receiving port |
| Length           | 16 |   | size of the UDP packet including header and data; minimum value is 64 bits, the length of the header.|
| Checksum         | 16 |   | the 16-bit 1's complement of the 1's complement sum of the pseudo header; if the checksum is cleared, then checksumming is disabled.|

<br>
To add more detail in how the checksum computation occurs, a 1's complement sum is derived from the IP header, UDP header, and the data. If a carry bit is derived from any of the 1's complement arithmetic addition, then the carry bit is added to the least significant bit of the running total. In the end, the final sum is once more 1's complemented to produce the final UDP checksum value. Note that the checksum is optional for IPv4, but it is mandatory for IPv6.
