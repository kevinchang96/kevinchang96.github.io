The combination of the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) make up the IP suite, also known as TCP/IP. In a previous [post]({% post_url 2020-02-12-IPv4 %}), we explored the IP layer; namely IPv4. TCP and IP work in concert to achieve a singular goal -- end-to-end data communication between devices. <!--more-->TCP and IP cannot be used synonymously as they each accomplish separate, but equally important tasks. While IP handles addressing and packet routing, TCP makes up for all the aspects that IP lacks. While IP is a connectionless protocol, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol focused on providing reliable data integrity, proper data sequencing, and data duplication avoidance.

TCP relies on IP to handle all the addressing and routing of packets, while it is concerned with making sure the communication is smooth and seamless. In this way, data can be divided into packets, sent off traveling in different routes, and reassembled when all the datas arrive at the destination device. Simplistically, TCP follows 3 fundamental steps.

Firstly, TCP establishes a connection between devices through the `3-way handshake`. Imagine two devices, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, that want to start a communication channel with each other. Relying on IP as the foundation for the communication, the following procedure occurs.

<!-- A sends a "SYN" (synchronize) packet to B.
If A does not receive any "ACK" (acknowledge) packets from B, then A will resend SYN packets until it receives a response.
Once B receives the SYN packet from A, B will respond by sending both an ACK packet and SYN packet to A.
If B does not receive any ACK packets from A, then B will resend both ACK and SYN packets until it receives a response.
Once A receives the ACK packet from B, it has successfully sent B a message and received a response back. To finish the handshake, A must acknowledge that it has received the SYN packet from B by sending it an ACK packet. -->

If no issues occur, then this process is simplified as a 3-step protocol to establish a connection between the parties involved in the communication.

After the connection has been established, every time a sending device sends data, the receiving device will respond with an `ACK` to confirm the reception of the data. Otherwise the sending device will resend the specific packet of data for which it did not receive a corresponding `ACK` within a specified period of time.

Finally, similar to the initial 3-way handshake to establish a connection, there is an analogous 3-way handshake to end a connection between devices. Again imagine two devices, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, that want to terminate a communication channel.

<!-- A sends a "FIN" (finish) packet to B
If A does not receive any ACK packets from B, then A will resend FIN packets until it receives a response.
Once B receives the FIN packet from A, B will respond by sending both an ACK packet and a FIN packet to A.
If B does not receive any ACK packets from A, then B will resend both ACK and FIN packets until it receives a response.
Once A receives the ACK packet from B, it knows that B has received its request to end the connection and has acknowledged this request. To finish the handshake, A must acknowledge that it has received the FIN packet from B by sending it a final ACK packet. -->

As we can see, this protocol is nearly identical to the opening 3-way handshake except the `SYN` packets have been swapped with `FIN` packets.

To understand, how TCP manages all the moving pieces to provide reliable transmission, it is informative to take a look at the composition of a TCP header packet.

Possibly most noteworthy is the **sequence number** and **acknowledgement number** which provide the capability of reliable transmission and error detection. To transmit reliably, one must protect against incorrect packet ordering, packet duplication, and packet loss. Therefore packets can be reconstructed in the proper order through the sequence number. Note that the initial sequence number starting off the sequence should be arbitrary to safeguard against [TCP sequence prediction attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_sequence_prediction_attack).

Furthermore, the acknowledgement number indicates the value of the sequence number that it is expecting to receive. Since acknowledgment numbers are cumulative, this indicates that the receiver has received all packets up to but excluding the sequence number that it is expecting to receive.

For example, if there is a sequence of sequence numbers from `1` to `10` and the packets with sequence numbers `6` and `9` were lost. Then the receiving device would send **6** as the acknowledgement number until it receives the sequence number `6` packet. Once it has received that packet, then the receiver will continually send **9** until it receives the sequence number `9` packet, and so forth. If the receiver sends 3 duplicate acknowledgment packets, then the sender will resend the last unacknowledged packet.
